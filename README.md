# Sailce

An implementation of the [Willow](https://willowprotocol.org/) protocol for peer-to-peer data
stores.  Currently, Sailce is very incomplete.

The word ["sailce"](https://la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/lojban/index.html#sisku=sailce) means
willow, in the Lojban language.  Maybe this name should be changed to something less weird, but
it serves as a distinct code-name for now.
