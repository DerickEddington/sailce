# sailce_data_model

An implementation of Willow's [Data Model](https://willowprotocol.org/specs/data-model/index.html).

Willow is a system for giving meaningful hierarchical names to arbitrary sequences of bytes
(called _payloads_), not unlike a filesystem, for multiple peers.

TODO:  More test coverage.  (There are some basic tests so far.)
